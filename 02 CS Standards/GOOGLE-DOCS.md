# The standards on Google Docs

As of 2026-08-29 the CS standards live as Google Docs in Simon's Drive, in a
folder at his My Drive root, and **that is where the team edits them from now
on** (his call, this date). Uploaded from the Rev-current markdown via Drive's
markdown import; figures are embedded in each Doc (Drive fetched them from the
live app host at import time), so the Docs are self-contained.

**2026-09-02: ten Docs re-imported, new IDs.** The folder renumbering
changed `04 Datasheets/` to `03 Datasheets/` and `03 App/` to
`06 Composites App/` inside CS-000, 002, 003, 004, 006, 007, 008, 009, 011 and
013. The Drive connector cannot edit a Doc's text in place and the gcloud
token lacks the Docs API scope, so those ten were re-imported from the
corrected markdown (no rev bump: a path fix rides free, Simon's call) and the
old copies trashed. None had been edited since the 2026-08-29 upload, so no
content was lost. Their IDs above are the new ones; the other six are
unchanged. Same mechanism next time: a Doc that needs a repo-side fix is
re-imported, not patched, until something can call the Docs API.

## What this changes

The Docs are the **editing surface**. The markdown in `src/` is still what
builds everything the app serves: the in-app PDFs, the QR-linked copies under
`docs/standards/`, the .docx files, and what `check_traceability.py` audits.
So after edits land in a Doc, a session syncs them back: read the Doc (Drive
connector, IDs above), apply the change to `src/*.md` with a revision bump per
CS-000 §7.2, rebuild (`build_docx.py --all`, `gen_docs_manifest.py`), and push.
Until a sync happens, the Doc is ahead of the app copies, which is fine for
prose and wrong for numbers; sync promptly when a number changes.

Figures are embedded pixels in the Docs, not live links. When a figure's SVG
is re-rendered, re-import the affected standard (or swap the image in the Doc
by hand) or the Doc keeps the old drawing.
