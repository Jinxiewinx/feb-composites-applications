# Session state

Rolling handoff file, per working rule 2 in `CLAUDE.md`. If a session got cut off
by a usage limit, read this first. Update it as work proceeds, not just when
stopping.

Keep it short. Durable state only: decisions made, work in flight, open
questions. Not a transcript.

Status: no work in flight, clean stopping point.

## Where things stand

The composites app is live at feb-composites.web.app and the whole SN6 Resources
handoff is on GitHub at Jinxiewinx/feb-composites-applications (public, `main`).
As of 2026-07-21 the repo holds all of `00` through `05` plus `tools/`, not just
the app.

Most recent work: the printed work-order traveler. Printing a work order now
produces a purpose-built hand-fillable form instead of a screenshot of the app.
Finished and pushed. `tools/test_app.mjs` is at 67 passing.

## Decisions made (don't relitigate)

### Repo

The git root is this folder, not `03 Work Orders/`. The scripts in `tools/`
resolve `Path(__file__).parent.parent / "03 Work Orders"`, so they only run from
one level up. `firebase deploy` still runs from inside `03 Work Orders/`.

Push over HTTPS, never SSH. The machine's SSH key authenticates as
`starbuckgold`, but the repo belongs to `Jinxiewinx`, which is the `gh` CLI
account. `ssh -T git@github.com` reporting success is misleading here.

The repo is public, Simon's call. Scanned clean: no credentials, no
`@berkeley.edu` addresses, no member names in the seed data. The Firebase
`apiKey` in `app/firebase-config.js` is a public web config by design, since
security lives in `firestore.rules`.

### Printed traveler

The print document is its own DOM, built by `app/print.js` into `#printroot`,
rather than the screen view restyled. `@media print` only chooses which of `#app`
and `#printroot` is visible, keyed off `body.sheet`.

`print.css` is deliberately not inside `@media print`. The sheet renders
identically on screen and on paper, which is what makes the preview trustworthy
and lets the design be reviewed from a screenshot. Don't tidy it into a
print-only block; that breaks the whole review loop.

Shop-traveler styling, black-and-white laser first. Every distinction has to
survive grayscale, so blockers use hatching plus heavy rules plus the literal
word BLOCKER, never colour alone. Berkeley blue and gold are enhancement only.

Blank trailing rows are a feature, not slack. See `BLANK_ROWS` and
`BLANK_FORM_ROWS` in `print.js`. Shrinking them to save paper defeats the point,
since Simon asked for room to add lines by hand.

Retro records store the literal string `"not recorded (retro)"`. `pv()` maps that
to empty so it never reaches paper looking like data. Blank forms build their
steps from `STD_STEPS`, so a blank is a real procedure rather than empty ruling.

Page numbering is hand-written (`Page ___ of ___`). Chrome doesn't support
`@page` margin-box counters, so there's no honest way to print it.

## Open questions for Simon

Nothing blocking.

The full traveler runs about 3 pages for a complete work order, 2 for a blank.
That's the cost of the generous fill-in space. Say if it should be tightened.

## Notes for whoever picks this up

The visual review harness is `tools/print-preview.html`. It needs a real HTTP
origin, since the seed JSON fetch is blocked on `file://`. Run
`python3 -m http.server 8777` from this folder, then open
`http://localhost:8777/tools/print-preview.html`. It has toggles for blank form,
B&W proof, margin guides and page breaks, plus a readout of approximate page
count and horizontal overflow.

Test harness gotcha: `tools/test_app.mjs` concatenates the app's classic scripts
into one indirect `eval`. Top-level `const` stays lexical and is invisible to the
tests, so the harness rewrites a named list
(`STD_STEPS|WO_STATUSES|PROCESSES|BLANK_ROWS|BLANK_FORM_ROWS`) into implicit
globals. Adding a new app file means adding it to `FILES` too, or the harness
silently won't see it.

`firebase.json`'s no-cache header now covers `css` as well as `html|js|json`. It
previously didn't, which would have served `print.css` stale for an hour. Same
class of cache bug that bit Simon during initial setup.

Storage-backed features (avatar and file upload) still need the Firebase Blaze
plan. They're built and tested against the emulator. Emulator hosting port is
5050, because macOS AirPlay squats on 5000.

## Next up (not started)

- Port the traveler to the offline single-file `work-orders.html`, which still
  has the old print CSS.
- `reports.js` "Print status board" still calls raw `window.print()`.
- `05 Printables/printables.html` is open to redesign. Simon said it isn't a
  house style to conform to.
- The CS standards in `02 CS Standards/src/` haven't been swept for AI writing
  patterns. They're versioned documents with approval tables, so a prose edit
  means a revision bump under CS-000. Ask before touching them.
